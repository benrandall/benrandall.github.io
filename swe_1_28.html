          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>This past week I helped a friend film a music video and finished up a song that came out of blue a few days ago. I did a lot of initial reading for classes; I can tell this is going to be a reading intensive semester. Also, I caught up with some friends I didn't see over the winter break.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>Focus, or lack of. I feel like I'm splitting my valuable time between this class, boring required classes, musical projects, and other miscellaneous responisbilities. I feel a little thinly spread, but I'm sure it is just the beginning of the semester blues.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>My main focus this week is this Collatz project. I haven't run into many problems yet, but I have much more to finish. I need to start planning for a show I have in two weeks. I've never really played much of my music live, so I need to really figure out what I can do with the hardware I have. Additionally, I need to get my resume and myself ready for the career fairs coming up.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>I like learning about simple real-world software engineering procedures and such. I can't believe I've made it this far into my studies and I just now feel the least bit prepared for something practical. There was some initial confusion when I was setting up the collatz project in the separate repositories and Travis CI, but now that part I'm through it I feel much more comfortable. I can see how Travis CI could be extremely useful when collaborating with a team. Somewhat unrelated to the class itself, but I like having a class at 10am, when I feel the most awake and alert.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p>I just switched from the Sublime text editor to Atom. I liked Sublime for the most part, but I really feel as though Atom was designed for the type of work I'm now doing. I like being able to push and pull from the app itself. Also, the sidebar tells you changed, added, and deleted files. I don't know if Sublime has these capabilites, but Atom set itself up like this from the start. Atom might be a very useful tool in a few weeks when version control will become increasingly important! If you're interested, Atom is free and downloadable <a href="https://atom.io/">on their website</a>.</p>

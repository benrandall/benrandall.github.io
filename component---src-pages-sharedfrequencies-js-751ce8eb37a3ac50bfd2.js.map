We mostly stream local DJs, but also host multiple other artists as well. Check out <a href=\"https://sharedfrequencies.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">our website</a> or <a href=\"https://sharedfrequencies.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">our Instagram</a>.</p>\r\n                <p>My roles include technical expert, creative director, graphic artist, and much more. Shared Frequencies has become a catch-all creative outlet for me.</p>\r\n                <img src={studiopic}/>\r\n                <p>Before I could get too creative, I had to design the studio space and the signal flow.</p>\r\n                <img src={studiodiagram}/>\r\n                <p>The audio and video run into a PC. The PC runs TouchDesigner, realtime visual processing software, and OBS, a streaming software. The live video streams to our Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, and website.</p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <p>I find myself doing all kinds of things for the station, from graphic design to resident DJ to studio manager to new talent outreach.</p>\r\n                <img src={stream1}/>\r\n                <img src={stream2}/>\r\n                <p>I also took it upon myself to push a cohesive creative direction for the station, which is something I had never really done before. Branding is a mysterious and powerful field, and I wanted to get my feet wet. I spent time creating covers for Mixcloud, building up social media style guides with our intern (who joined the team soon after), and creating whatever other content was needed.</p>\r\n                <div className=\"mixcover-row\">\r\n                    <img className=\"mixcover\" src={mixcover1}/>\r\n                    <img className=\"mixcover\" src={mixcover2}/>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"mixcover-row\">\r\n                    <img className=\"mixcover\" src={mixcover3}/>\r\n                    <img className=\"mixcover\" src={mixcover4}/>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </Layout>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SharedFrequencies;"],"sourceRoot":""}

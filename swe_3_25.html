          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>This past week my team and I worked on finishing up the second phase of our IDB project. We had a lot more problems figuring out testing frameworks than we had planned for, and deployment was very difficult. Luckily, I had a great team who pulled more than their weight. Outside of this class, I dedicated a lot of time to a DJ set I have been preparing, which went really well.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>I feel like I got over some major roadblocks for now. The past week was busy for sure, so anything on the horizon feels relatively small. I have a long essay I have to prepare for in a government class. It has been a long time since I've written anything close to eight pages, so the thought of that process is pretty intimidating. Other than a few small assignments, there's not much in my way!</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>I have a lot to catch up on next week in this class and out. I need to catch up on readings for this class and look into the specifics of SQL and relational databases. Sounds riveting. I also have to start looking at IDB phase three. In other classes I have tests, quizzes, and assignments I need to prepare for.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>This phase of the IDB project was definitely hard, but I'm not sure if it was harder than the first phase. Again, I have a really great team who puts their hard work and experience to good use. It is great to be able to learn from them as the project goes. There is a definite rhythym to the class that I have picked up on, which makes a lot of things easier. If everything continues to my expectations, I think I could see myself solidly landing an A in this class.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p>I am sure that many people heard about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/23/17156804/dropbox-ipo-stock-shares-up-40-percent-market-debut-snapchat">Dropbox's stock jumping 36 percent on its NASDAQ debut</a>. This is significantly the biggest tech IPO since Snapchat. Dropbox ended the day of trading, under the ticker symbol “DBX,” with a market valuation of around $10 billion. I was reading about how investors are all over the "subscription" model of a product, like Netflix or a paid Dropbox account. It provides a solid, predictable stream of revenue that makes companies like Dropbox a safe investment. Dropbox started 10 years ago as a small startup in the San Francisco-based Y Combinator incubator program; it makes me wonder if I'll see any of my fellow students in similar news someday soon!</p>

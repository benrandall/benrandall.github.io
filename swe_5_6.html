          <p><b>What did you like the least about the class?</b></p>
          <p>I didn't like that the project required knowledge that was seemingly very separate from what we were learning about in lectures. The TA presentations were necessary to get me and my team through the projects, but the lectures weren't as much.</p>
          <p><b>What did you like the most about the class?</b></p>
          <p>Even when the subject material got very nuanced and not exciting, I was still pretty engaged throughout lectures because of the class set up. I also liked working on Hackerranks with other people in the class.</p>
          <p><b>What's the most significant thing you learned?</b></p>
          <p>Learning individual tools and languages is always useful, but I think the most valuable experience from this class was learning how many tools all fit together. It is a huge effort putting so many required and optional tools together for a web development project, and not a common experience for the classroom.</p>
          <p><b>How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?</b></p>
          <p>Adding the project and the other class work together, I'd estimate that I spent 6 to 8 hours a week on average coding for this class.</p>
          <p><b>How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?</b></p>
          <p>I spent roughly two hours a week on the required readings and another two hours reading documentation to better my understanding of tools and languages.</p>
          <p><b>How many lines of code do you think you wrote?</b></p>
          <p>If I were to count all the IDB code, Hackerrank code, and both exams, I'd guess I wrote somewhere a little shy of 1000 lines of code. I've never tried to estimate how much code I've written before, and especially not over an entire semester, so my guess is probably not accurate.</p>
          <p><b>What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?</b></p>
          <p>I like the idea of GitBook. GitBook went through some changes throughout the semester, but I've come to realize how important organized documentation is.</p>
          <p><b>What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?</b></p>
          <p>One tool that ended up helping us a lot was Zeplin integrated with Adobe XD. Zeplin is an intuitive way to m</p>
          <p><b>If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?</b></p>
          <p>I think there's an uncomfortable disparity between what we learn in class, what we read about, and what our project requires us to know. IF those three areas could be reconciled in some way, I think I would have had a better experience in this class.</p>

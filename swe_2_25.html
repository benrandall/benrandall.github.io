          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>The past week was full of career fairs, interviews, conversations, and organizing an internship search. I got to leverage this class and what I've learned so far in a lot of conversations with recruiters and interviewers, which was really cool. Being able to talk about this class definitely is motivating, as I've taken a lot of classes I will probably never even think about again.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>There is a lot of studying and preparation for Exam 1 to be done. I think I have done a pretty good job absorbing what we learned in class by going over notes, but I need to force myself to sit down and really internalize everything I've learned in the past month, including any details I may have originally missed out on.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>This week I will fully commit to preparing for Exam 1. After the test on Thursday, our team will take on the bulk of the work needed to complete project 3. We need to makea database and move our pseudo database to a real database. Another large task is making tests and a UML diagram. We also need to restructure the project folder to the rubric.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>So far, so good. My little brother is visiting UT to check out the computer science program, so I'll be taking him to this class tomorrow. I think he'll appreciate Downing's lecturing style. The article readings have been interesting and I still look forwards to every class.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p>While researching Docker technology, I came across <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/docker-has-a-business-plan-headache/">this ZDNet article</a> about the business side of Docker's operations. Docker is surely the service of choice for many when it comes to container technology. However, Docker's business is not doing very well: Docker provides the open-source framework for the most popular container format. That's great for users, but it's not a great business plan. According to 451 Research, "the application container market will explode over the next five years. Annual revenue is expected to increase by 4x, growing from $749 million in 2016 to more than $3.4 billon by 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35 percent." So, while Docker is on top of one of the hottest markets of tomorrow, it's anyone's guess if they survive as a company that long.</p>

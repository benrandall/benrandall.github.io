          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>This past week we deployed our site for project 2 and cleaned up the design. I spent more hours getting this project ready to turn in than I initially accounted for. There was a lot to do even after we finished the site: we had to write the GitBooks technical report, document the API, and write reviews of ourselves, our team, and our peers.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>I am a little nervous about interviewing with companies as summer intern recruiting season starts. I didn't do a great job finding something to do over the summer in the fall, so it's make or break now. I have been sending companies my resume like crazy and I've already gotten some calls back, so I am feeling hopeful now.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>I will put most of my energy this week on looking for a summer internship. There is a FoCS night on Monday and the career fair is on Tuesday. The career fair is exhausting enough, but a lot of work will go into applying and following up with companies post-fair. Additionally, a round of midterms is beginning soon, so I will have to prepare for that.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>I don't always do well on the in-class quizzes, so I am starting to think that I am not studying effectively after each class. Up to now, most of the material we learn in class is simple enough for me to score well on each quiz from memory, but now I think that is starting to change. Otherwise, I like the group project aspect to the class. I appreciate the opportunities this class gives me to practice teamwork.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/">This article</a> on the inner turmoil that has occured in the past two years at Facebook is very long but extremely well-written and interesting. The insane amount of influence Facebook has on the public is just now being realized by the corporation. Facebook does not want to be recognized as a publication with any kind of bias, yet it still wants to be able to be a fair platform that protects its users against so-called "fake news." If you've been wondering how Facebook has been dealing with the political and social climate of the past two years, I recommend this read.</p>

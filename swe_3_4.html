          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>I spent the first half of the week taking Hackerrank quizzes and studying notes from the past month. Exam 1 ended up not being as challenging as I had expected. I had prepared a lot so I felt good going into the test, and know I know what to expect for future tests. Outside of this class, I did a lot of interviewing in preparation for summer.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>Technical interviews and more school projects are on the horizon. Additionally, I am getting around to switching all my information from one personal website to another newer one I made. Project 3 also has a lot of work left to be done.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>I haven't done very much to contribute to our group project yet, so I need to step it up. Next week I have a few more coding challenges in which I hope to be able to leverage some knowledge I have gained in this class. I have to go to Dallas for some interviews as well.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>Exam 1 was intimidating, but after taking it I realized I'm much more prepared for this class than I thought I was. There weren't really any tricks, so just following Downing's suggestions on how to study made things very simple. I think I'm beginning to like the readings a little bit more also. Big picture object-oriented programming conventions are very important in a software engineering career.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p>During the preparation of our first exam, I noticed that many students were collaborating on our one-page cheat sheet we were afforded. I think collaborative study is very important and it helps me out a lot, but I definitely have to urge everyone to be careful about using other people's cheat sheet. I think one of the most helpful aspects to a cheat sheet is the process of creating it. If you have to think about every individual thing that is put on the sheet, you will learn much more. If you simply print out someone else's cheat sheet, sure you have the information in front of you, but sometimes it's not easy to interpret or recall. To me, cheat sheets serve more as memory maps to jog general ideas with specifics.</p>

          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>This past week I traveled to Dallas for interviews and missed two days of classes. Besides stressing about some tests and quizzes, I took it easy this week looking towards spring break.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>I ended up getting the internship I've been pursuing heavily, so all the interviews and networking has paid off! I'm glad I am done with the hard parts of this recruiting season so I can concentrate more on my school work. I am putting off a lot of things for after the break, so I know I will come back to a full schedule after some relaxation.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>Next week is spring break, I am driving to Nashville to be a tourist for a bit and experiencing some of SXSW on the side. I maybe definitely won't be thinking too hard about JavaScript. The week after that, I know I will have a lot to do getting back into the groove with classes. Our group has to showcase the second phase of our project by Wednesday and turn it in by Friday. There is not too much left to do, but documentation is always a bit of a pain.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>As a group, we were proud of our first idb project iteration. We got a few points taken off for things we didn't really understand and gave us some questions. The grade received was satisfactory to me, but getting the grade back and seeing missed points for seemingly unfair things was a bit of a negative experience. Outside the project, I do appreciate learning more about SQL and its applications. I will be using SQL a lot in my internship, so I know I'll be paying close attention in class.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-uber/self-driving-uber-car-kills-arizona-woman-crossing-street-idUSKBN1GV296"> This article on Reuters</a> documents the incident in Arizona where an self-driving car owned by Uber ran into and killed a pedestrian. Some say this could mean doom for the self-driving car technologies, but I think it's an inevitable bump in the road (bad pun not intended). Our car-based transportation system is far and away the most dangerous thing any of us accept doing on a daily basis; 40,000 die a year. Sadly, I believe an incident like this was bound to happen at some point.</p>

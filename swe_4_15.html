          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>This past week I spent my down time catching up with classes outside of this one and prepared my fall class schedule for next year. I am still unclear exactly what my schedule will look like next year, but at least I'm getting closer to an idea. In this class, I read up on refactoring and how important the concept actually is.  I also started reading an interesting new book, Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>Clearly wrapping up our IDB project won't be an easy task. While most of the required functionality is there, we still have a lot of aesthetics to get down. There are also some broken parts of our site that could possibly be challenging to fix.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>Next week my team and I will prepare the finishing touches on our IDB project! It was a really great experience working on an expansive project such as this one and I learned a lot. I will take what I've learned in class the past few days about refactoring and apply it to a lot of the functioning code I have already written.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>I am glad we are diving into some really important object oriented programming conventions. As I plan to start my career after college, knowing these conventions will get me a step ahead and allow me to avoid learning them on the job as I go. The refactoring book we are reading is a little outdated, which is disappointing, but the ideas behind the readings are still solid. It is definitely hard to keep up to date with technology in academia, so I'm not really surprised some material is outdated.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p>This past week has really reminded me that as busy as I get with school or work, I have to leave time for my hobbies. Last week I started a new book, finished up a new DJ set I will be performing today, and hosted a Melee tournament with my friends. While they might not advance me academically in a direct way, I think they do a real service by keeping my mind balanced and satisfied. Make a little time for whatever it is you love and your brain and body will thank you!</p>

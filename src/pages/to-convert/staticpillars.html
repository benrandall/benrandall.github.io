                <br />
                <p>I put the final touches on the TV tower last week. It stands a little over 6 feet tall.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="assets/demo.gif"></img></p>
                <p>My original plan was to have 8 TVs, but considering the goal of interactivity, this ended up not making sense. I could barely interact with the top of the frame when everything was put together. I could've planned to have 9 TVs in a 3x3, but that is more outputs than my computer supports.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Last week I spent time setting up a small-scale demo; I used four TVs instead of the planned eight. An important part of this project, to me, is adjusting for the spaces between displays (aka bezel correction). The animations feel more like a part of the real world when they have been spaced properly.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="assets/ezgif-1-5b7b370708b1.gif"></img></p>
                <br />
                <p>I simply used TouchDesigner's Crop TOP to overshoot the bounds and added them back together, resulting in the triangle image below. Of course, I could also space individual containers in the parent container, but I found this way easier to think about and adjust.</p>

                <p>As you can see in the gif below, I began to experiment with the RealSense camera to provide interactivity. I am moving the camera around quite a bit, but you can see the outline of a friend who was standing directly in front of me. The extra noise was a nearby wall.</p>

                <p>I have found that I severely misjudged my initial budget. I initially did no planning on how I was to make the installation interactive, so I had to add the cost of the depth camera to my total. With that, I also had to buy a fairly expensive extension cable for the camera. Additionally, all the wood, screws, brackets, paint, and power tool rental added up quickly. My total cost over budget was about $350.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Last week I finished the construction of three "shells" for the TVs. I don't have much experience with woodworking, but it went well. After constructing them, I tried to put the TVs on top but the structure was extremely unstable. I happened to have two spare long, sturdy planks which I also painted black. With the planks, the structure is much sturdier.</p>

                <p><i>Installation vs Performance</i></p>
                <br />
                <p>As I work on this project, I keep two applications in mind: a performance piece and an installation piece. The setup is unique enough to work as either and so I am designing it in a way that is flexible. The separate pieces can all fit in my car, yet when all set up, both towers are over 10 feet tall. I am concentrating on the performance aspect right now; however the installation piece will be the final goal.</p>
                <br />
                <p><i>Performance</i></p>
                <br />
                <p>Currently, I work with two VJs; one uses VDMX and the other uses Resolume. I want them to be able to use the TV set up as a performance piece, yet still allow them to use their personal computers and controllers with minimal effort. NewTek NDI exists for this exact purpose: NewTek’s NDI technology "enables compatible systems, devices, and applications to connect and communicate over IP to share video, audio, and data." VDMX Resolume, and TouchDesigner all support NDI; it's perfect!</p>
                <br />
                <p>... until I realized TouchDesigner requires a commercial or educational license to use the NDI TOP. To work around this, I had my VJs install TouchDesigner on their machines, and set up this very simple network:</p>
                <br />
                <p><img src="assets/screen-shot-2018-10-29-at-8-19-13-pm.png"></img></p>
                <br />
                <p>I then have them route their respective VJ software to output using <a href="http://syphon.v002.info/" target="_blank">Syphon</a> and then connect their Touch Out TOP to my Touch In TOP over a local network. This workaround probably exists in order to get TouchDesigner on people's machines, but it works for now and doesn't require an expensive license.</p>

                <p>My Intel RealSense camera arrived a few days ago and I've been playing around with it to see what it can do. I was initially disappointed because I thought it would support hand and face recognition out of the box, but it doesn't. However, the depth camera works pretty well and I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what I can possibly use it for.</p>

                <br />
                <p>I spent a while planning the physical structure that would hold the TV's as well. I decided to build individual cases for each TV rather than a giant shelf so that I can transport them easier. Now I just have to build the thing...</p>

                <br />

                </p>
                <p>Once I finished the computer, I immediately ordered HDMI to RCA converters and got to work testing the CRT TV's.</p>
                <p><img src="assets/tvtest.gif"></img></p>
                <p>With a little tweaking, the setup worked almost immediately. I figured out later that the bottom right TV's converter was set to <a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/NTSC_vs_PAL" target="_blank">PAL instead of NTSC.</a></p>
                <br />
                <p>On Saturday, I got a chance to use the TV's at a show my group "RTFX" put on at 21st Street Co-op called Neuromancy RTFX. In addition to an installation piece, the TV's work great as a performance tool. Having a 2x4 wall of 8 TV's displaying one continuous image would make this effect even more impressive.</p>
                <p><img src="assets/tvs.gif"></img></p>
                <p>This is slightly off topic, but here's a short video of the show we put on. It's inspiring to see what visuals people got into and was fun to hear people talk about how cool the set up was. As you can see, we also set up lights and a projector where we were showing separate visuals at the same time.</p>

                <br />

                <p><i>Ideation:</i></p>
                <br />
                <p>On Sunday I visited the Generative Art Project here in Austin. While it was inspiring, a talk with the owners led me to the realization that I was pulled more towards using technology for entertainment rather than fine art. Sometimes you have to get ideas of what you don't want to do before you know what you do want to do.</p>
                <br />
                <p><i>Design:</i></p>
                <br />
                <p>Once I decide on a general path of ideas, I will start to design the physical structures to hold the TV's and start on art direction. I'm estimating that this phase will begin in another three weeks, about October 22.</p>
                <br />
                <p><i>Implementation:</i></p>
                <br />
                <p>After some design, the implementation will begin. I'm estimating this will start in November.</p>

                <p><i>Nothing gets done without some proper planning...</i></p>
                <br />
                <p>I spend the first two weeks consulting with my faculty mentors Sven Ortel and Michael McKellar about many different aspects of the project. I have also named my project "Static Pillars," but I expect that will most likely change as the project evolves.</p>
                <br />
                <p>With Sven's help, I formulated a plan of attack. I would divide my project into two main phases; first, I would build the bulk of the infrastructure needed to run my project. This includes researching technologies, gathering parts, and putting everything together. Next, I would focus on the creative aspect of the project; this will include formulating a message or idea and visualizing it through art.</p>
                <br />
                <p>For now, I'm deep into phase 1. I ended up deciding that the best way to run my project was to build a Windows PC with enough graphics processing power to run eight displays.  After I finished some rough budgeting on the project as a whole, Michael helped me pick appropriate parts for a PC and I ordered them shortly after. I used PC Part Picker to keep myself organized. You can view my build <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/ben_randall/saved/GtqdXL" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                <br />
                <p>As I've never built a PC before, or even know if this whole system is going to work, I am a little anxious and excited to see where the next two weeks takes me. Once the final piece of the PC ships to me on Saturday, I will work on building the rig and immediately start testing and experimenting with displays. In about two weeks, I'm excited to test out some visual ideas and sketches at a <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1161125" target="_blank">party/concert/rave</a> I am throwing. So far, I have 4 of the ideal 8 CRT TV's in my possession and I can't wait to test them out.</p>

                <br />
                <p>At its core, my creative project will juxtapose cutting edge interactive visuals on technologies of the past in a seamless way. I will design and build an interconnected system of CRT TVs that will display interactive visuals as one continuous image. Each TV will be in it’s own custom-build wooden box, which will allow me to stack the TVs into a sort of makeshift sculpture. This system doubles as visual tool for live music performances and an art installation that can be simply set up and switched on. I want to do this project because I believe people will be captivated by the visuals and how the system works.</p>
                <br />
                <p>This project will require quite a lot of hardware. I will need 8 CRT TVs to function as the screen, 8 custom-built wooden cases to hold each TV, 1 custom-built computer to run TouchDesigner and hold 2 graphics cards to total 8 hdmi/dvi outputs. Additionally, I will need hdmi/dvi to composite video converters and various other cables and power sources to support the infrastructure.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I will learn how to create digital art for performances and installations and will research building a computer, learn the TouchDesigner program, and finally create the art that will be displayed. I will be creating art that utilizes my computer science background and blends my passion for interactive art, music, and technology in a unique way. My primary faculty mentor, Sven Ortel, has deep knowledge of performance art and technology will be able steer me to use the best technologies and connect me with additional helpful people. This project will help push me to research and learn more about the digital interactive art area, which was a big reason for me pursuing

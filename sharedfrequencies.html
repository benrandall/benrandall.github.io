                <p>Shared Frequencies is an online community radio station started in early 2019 in Austin. We mostly stream local DJs, but also host multiple other artists as well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>My roles include technical expert, stream runner, artist, and more. Shared Frequencies has become a catch-all creative outlet for me in the past year.</p>

                <p><i>Technical Design</i></p>
                <p>Before I could get too creative, I had to design the studio space and the signal flow.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The audio and video run into a PC. The PC runs TouchDesigner, realtime visual processing software, and OBS, a streaming software. The live video streams to our Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, and website.</p>

                <p><i>Streams</i></p>
                <p>We invite DJs on the stream for monthly residencies. In the video below, I stream with my fellow label-owner Dreamgoth for our Helldotcom residency.</p>

                <p>In this stream, I am doing some extreme video processing that isn't typical for Shared Frequencies. However, since it was my stream I decided to experiment a bit.</p>

                <p><i>LED Wall</i></p>
                <p>During the summer of 2019, I had a creative itch to build something physical. I saw George Clanton play a show a few weeks before, and while he was great, I was mesmerized by the LED wall behind him. An LED wall is nothing novel, but what I noticed is that it was built on cloth material with two easy stands so he could tour around with it. I got the chance to talk to him after the show, but he was secretive about the details of the wall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>I decided this would make for an interesting research project. My initial plan was to run TouchDesigner through an Arduino board. After some experimenting, I was determined I could make interesting visuals work on the limited resolution.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="assets/ledwall_td.gif"></img>
                </p>
                <p>I planned out the physical design and it took me a few days to put together. I programmed some "default" visuals on the wall for a few Shared Frequencies streams.</p>
                <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
                    <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSharedFrequenciesRadio%2Fvideos%2F387806718751607%2F&show_text=0&width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>Unfortunately, I eventually realized that the Arduino board I didn't have the bandwidth to support the data from TouchDesigner quick enough, so the project has been shelved for now.</p>

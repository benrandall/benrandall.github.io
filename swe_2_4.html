          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>This past week I spent more time finishing up the Collatz project than I planned on, about 15 hours.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>Well, I just found out that I still have a high school bank account debit card with a $300 limit, which is very annoying. Back in highschool, I had a band with a few friends. We would make a fair amount of money from shows and such, so we decided to start a bank account. After we graduated and went our separate ways, I took it upon myself to close down the bank account, as we would no longer be needing it. I closed the account and collected the few dollars left over in the account. However, next month, I received my regular montly bank statement under not my own legal name... but my band's name. Somehow in closing the account, some details were merged, and some of my details were erased. To my bank, my name was now Drive More Drive and I was a high school student. Since then, I've talked to bank representatives, customer support, corporate customer support, basically everyone I could reach and no one can (or wants to) fix this problem. At this point, I'm probably just going to change banks.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>Next week I want to do some research for a side project idea I had last week. I've been meaning to do a side project for some extra experience and resume padding, but it's really hard to discipline myself. If I set due dates for myself and possibly build a small team, I'm sure it will be much easier to stick to a plan. I also have a few tests next week I need to start studying for.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>I liked learning about tools and workflow tips during the Collatz project, but I'm starting to find it a little harder to pay close attention to the in-class lectures. Python syntax and conventions can only hold my attention for so long. I haven't been struggling too much in this class so far, so I'm interested to see where this collaborative project goes.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p>I recommend reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases">this article on the Guardian</a> about location tracking data. There are many problems with companies releasing private user data, and this case is an alarming reality shock on how private companies can disrupt national security. In this instance, I don't believe Strava meant any ill-will, but accidents like this demonstrate how much we trust private companies with our sensitive data and probably don't even know it.</p>

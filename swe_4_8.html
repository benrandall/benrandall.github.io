          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>Last week my team and I worked hard to finish the third phase of the project. We got through it mostly fine, but it was difficult to work towards a good grade without knowing how we did on the second phase. I got a lot done outside of this class though, and I possibly got myself an internship in Tel Aviv next spring.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>The next phase of our IDB project is due in less than two weeks. I have to figure out how to programmatically scrape data from our chosen websites. Also,I've been thinking about studying or working abroad next spring, so I will have to figure out how I can get all the classes I need to get done out of the way before then. I have registration in two weeks, so I have a lot to decide on these next two weeks.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>Next week I will take care of some outstanding assignments, but mostly I will begin to prepare for my finals. I only have one scheduled final this semester, which means all my actual finals will be in the next three or four weeks. The good part of that is that I'm done before May.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>Again, it wasn't easy trying to cram a lot of fixes on our project into one day. I understand it's hard to grade these massive projects, but it is also hard to cater our projects to unclear rubrics, especially if we don't get feedback on the last section until the day it's due. If there was more time between receiving our grade and turning in our project, this would not be as big of a problem.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p>One of today's biggest tech buzzwords is definitely "blockchain." I am sure we have all heard it in one context or another, to various degrees of sensationalism. I recently read an opinion piece titled <a href="https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec">"Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the future."</a> The opinion is all in the title. According to the author, "There is no single person in existence who had a problem they wanted to solve, discovered that an available blockchain solution was the best way to solve it, and therefore became a blockchain enthusiast." I wouldn't take his word as law, but it is an interesting opinion.</p>

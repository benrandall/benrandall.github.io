          <p><b>What are your expectations of the class?</b></p>
          <p>I fully expect to put in a lot of hours reading, writing, and looking over class notes. Additionally, I expect to spend time with my team planning and programming our projects. I think that this class will be challenging, both in difficult material and time management; although, I hope I will find the subject interesting enough to not find the class a huge chore.</p>
          <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b></p>
          <p>I spent most of my time this past week settling back into my school life in Austin and gathering class materials. Once I had a good sense of what my classes were like, I started to formulate an idea of what my weekly schedule would look like. My day to day activities are definitely packed, but manageable.</p>
          <p><b>What's in your way?</b></p>
          <p>The main weight I have on me right now is the fact that I put off my required history and government classes until now, and I'm not very excited to take them both in this semester. It's frustrating to have to spend time and energy on those classes instead of focusing on the CS classes I care about, but I'm sure that once I get into a groove this semester, they won't feel like major roadblocks.</p>
          <p><b>What will you do next week?</b></p>
          <p>This next week I'm going to be attending first-of-the-semester meetings for orgs. It'll be fun to see friends and reconnect from break. I have some inital homework I need to work on, and I am also devoting some time to work on music. This week will be a settle-into-classes week.</p>
          <p><b>What's my experience of the class?</b></p>
          <p>So far I have really enjoyed Downing's style of lecturing and his ideas about learning in general. I don't know how well it works for other people, but I love hearing people get called on, because it forces me to think about the process he's explaining critically. The way lectures are logically progressed step-by-step makes a lot of sense to me. I'm not sure I understand the usefulness of the quiz aspect yet, but I've only been to two classes so far. I'm intersted to see where the class goes from here and I'm optimistic about my future experience in this class.</p>
          <p><b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b></p>
          <p>I recently read <a href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/">this post</a> about what "microservices" are in the software service world and why their concept means a lot to the trends of software development. It got me thinking about the web app project my team and I will start in a few weeks.</p>
